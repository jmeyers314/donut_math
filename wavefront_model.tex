\section{Introduction}

We aim to build a model for the HSC field-dependent optics wavefront that can be
trained using out-of-focus ``donut'' images of stars and then used to fit the
optics contribution of in-focus PSFs.  Developing this model is part of our
ongoing effort to factor the PSF into independent contributions from the
atmosphere, optics and sensors.  Such a factorization has many potential
benefits, the greatest of which is likely the ability to capture all of the
effects of CCD-to-CCD discontinuities into the optical component, allowing the
sensor and particularly the atmospheric component to be smoothly interpolated
across the entire field-of-view.  Additional benefits may also include enabling
a significant part of the PSF variation across the field of view to be captured
using just a few parameters, better characterization of high-frequency PSF
components that are not well constrained empirically using finitely sampled
data, and increased ability to characterize the wavelength dependence of the PSF
by characterizing the disparate wavelength dependencies of the individual
components.

\section{Model}

Our model for the optical part of a single star's PSF is Fourier optics.
Specifically, the optical PSF is described by a pupil-obscuration function and
wavefront function. (See DMTN-064 for more details).  Our primary concern for
this note is the spatial variability of the optical wavefront and therefore the
optical PSF over the field of view.  We break down the wavefront model of the
$i$th exposure into three constituent components as follows:

\begin{equation}
    W^i\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right) =
    W_\mathrm{tel}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right) +
    W_\mathrm{visit}^i\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right) +
    W_\mathrm{CCD}^{\phi_i}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right)
\end{equation}

In the above, $i$ is an index over exposures, $\phi_i$ is the rotator angle for
the $i$th exposure, $\vec{u}$ is a coordinate in the entrance pupil,
$\vec{\theta}$ is the field angle (or equivalently, a location on the focal
plane).  The coordinate system for $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{\theta}$ are understood
to align with the altitude and azimuth axes of the telescope. Note that this
implies that in the presence of a rotator, they are not fixed with respect to
focal plane or CCDs themselves.

The individual terms of the model are:

\begin{itemize}

  \item $W_\mathrm{tel}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right)$  This term is
  intended to model the wavefront perturbations that are present in the
  otherwise unperturbed optical design of the telescope.  It is independent of
  the exposure index $i$, and continuous over the pupil and field of view.

  \item $W_\mathrm{CCD}^{\phi_i}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right)$  This term
  is intended to model wavefront perturbations that are fixed to the CCD array,
  such as may originate from displacements in the heights of each CCD. It is
  continuous in the pupil, but we allow discontinuities between different CCDs
  across the focal plane.  Because this term is constant in focal-plane
  coordinates, but not in our alt-az aligned $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{\theta}$
  coordinates, it also depends on the rotator angle $\phi_i$.  Aside from the
  dependence on $\phi$, this term is constant in time.

  \item $W_\mathrm{visit}^i\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right)$  This dynamic
  term is intended to capture exposure-to-exposure differences (beyond the
  rotator angle), that may be due to flexure, temperature variations, or any
  other time-dependent continuous perturbation to the wavefront.  It explicitly
  depends on the exposure index $i$.

\end{itemize}

In DMTN-064, we described how we measured individual wavefronts for a limited
number of pairs of intra- and extra- focal images and specific locations within
the field of view.  For these ``donut'' images, we used a forward model that
decomposed the delivered wavefront into a Zernike polynomial series.  I.e.:

\begin{equation}
    W^i\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}_\ast\right) = \sum_{j=4}^{j_\mathrm{max}} a_j^i(\vec{\theta}_\ast) Z_j(\vec{u})
\end{equation}

In Figure \ref{fig:a69016} we show the field-of-view dependence of such fits to
one exposure.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{a69016.png}

    \caption{}

    \label{fig:a69016}
\end{figure}

It is useful to apply the same decomposition for the $\vec{u}$ dependence of the
model terms.  I.e., for the telescope and visit terms we will write:

\begin{equation}
    W_\mathrm{tel}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right) =
    \sum_j b^\mathrm{tel}_j (\vec{\theta}) Z_j(\vec{u})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W^i_\mathrm{visit}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right) =
    \sum_j c^i_j (\vec{\theta}) Z_j(\vec{u})
\end{equation}

We will write the CCD term using focal plane coordinates $\vec{u}^\prime$ and
$\vec{\theta}^\prime$ (instead of alt-az aligned coordinates), since these are
the coordinates in which there is no dependence on the rotator angle $\phi$, and
hence no dependence on the exposure index $i$:

\begin{equation}
    W^\prime_\mathrm{CCD}\left(\vec{u}^\prime; \vec{\theta}^\prime\right) =
    \sum_{j^\prime} d_{j^\prime} (\vec{\theta}^\prime) Z_{j^\prime}(\vec{u}^\prime)
\end{equation}

The trick now is to concretely model the $\vec{\theta}$ dependence which we left
purely abstract above.  For this, we will again use Zernike polynomials, forming
a double zernike basis.  For the telescope and visit terms this becomes:

\begin{equation}
    W_\mathrm{tel}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right) =
    \sum_{jk} b^\mathrm{tel}_{jk} Z_k(\vec{\theta}) Z_j(\vec{u})
    \label{eqn:Wtel}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W^i_\mathrm{visit}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right) =
    \sum_{jk} c^i_{jk} Z_k(\vec{\theta}) Z_j(\vec{u})
\end{equation}

For the CCD term, we additionally indicate which CCD $n$ the field angle
$\vec{\theta}^\prime$ projects to (using the indicator function
$\mathbb{1}_n(\vec{\theta}^\prime)$):

\begin{equation}
    W^\prime_\mathrm{CCD}\left(\vec{u}^\prime; \vec{\theta}^\prime\right) =
    \sum_{n j^\prime k} d_{n j^\prime k} \mathbb{1}_n(\vec{\theta}^\prime) Z_k(\vec{\theta}^\prime) Z_{j^\prime}(\vec{u}^\prime)
\end{equation}

To incorporate the rotator angle into the last equation, we assert

\begin{equation}
    W^\phi_\mathrm{CCD}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}\right) =
    W^\prime_\mathrm{CCD}\left(R^\phi\vec{u}; R^\phi\vec{\theta}\right)
\end{equation}

where $R^\phi$ is the normal 2D rotation matrix for angle $\phi$.  For a given
donut or star observation at $\vec{\theta}_\ast$ (in alt-az aligned field
angle), this leads to

\begin{equation}
    W^\phi_\mathrm{CCD}\left(\vec{u}; \vec{\theta}_\ast\right) =
    \sum_{n j^\prime k} d_{n j^\prime k} \mathbb{1}_n(R^\phi \vec{\theta}_\ast) Z_{j^\prime}(R^\phi \vec{u}) Z_k(R^\phi \vec{\theta}_\ast)
\end{equation}

The $Z_k(R^\phi \vec{\theta}_\ast)$ is simply a real number we can compute.  The
$Z_{j^\prime}(R^\phi \vec{u})$ factor is as yet a function here. We will find it
convenient to further decompose it into a series in $Z_j({\vec{u}})$
(eliminating the $R^\phi$) using the mathematics presented in (Tatulli (2013)
arXiv:1302.7106v1).  Namely

\begin{equation}
    Z_{j^\prime}(R^\phi \vec{u}) = \sum_{j} M_{j j^\prime}^\phi Z_{j}(\vec{u})
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
    M_{j j^\prime}^\phi = \delta_{n n^\prime} \times \begin{cases}
    \cos(m \phi), & m = m^\prime \\
    \sin(m \phi), & m = -m^\prime \\
    0 & |m| \ne |m^\prime|
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $n$ ($n^\prime$) and $m$ ($m^\prime$) are the radial and azimuthal indices
of the Zernike polynomial with Noll index $j$ ($j^\prime$).  Note that rows or
columns of $M^\phi_{j j^\prime}$ only ever have at most 2 non-zero entries (when
$n = n^\prime$ and $m = \pm m^\prime$).  With this decomposition, we obtain
for each of $W_\mathrm{tel}$, $W_\mathrm{visit}$, and $W_\mathrm{CCD}$ a series
in alt-az aligned pupil Zernikes $Z_j(\vec{u})$.

\section{Donut fits}

\subsection{Formalism}

To determine the unknown coefficients $b^\mathrm{tel}_{jk}$, $c^i_{jk}$, and
$d_{n j^\prime k}$ of our model from a set of pupil Zernike measurements
$\left\{a^*_j\right\}$, we minimize the least squares residual over the
wavefronts:

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
    &\sum_{\ast} \int \dif{\vec{u}} \left\{\mathrm{data} - \mathrm{model}\right\}^2 \\
    &\sum_{\ast}
    \int \dif{\vec{u}} \left\{\sum_j a_j^\ast Z_j(\vec{u})
    - \sum_{jk} b^\mathrm{tel}_{jk} Z_k(\vec{\theta}_\ast) Z_j(\vec{u})
    - \sum_{ijk} \mathbb{1}_i(\ast) c^i_{jk} Z_k(\vec{\theta}_\ast) Z_j(\vec{u})
    - \sum_{injk} \mathbb{1}_n(R^{\phi_i} \vec{\theta}_\ast) \mathbb{1}_i(\ast) \sum_{j^\prime} d_{n j^\prime k} M^{\phi_i}_{j j^\prime} Z_k(R^{\phi_i} \vec{\theta}_\ast) Z_j(\vec{u})
    \right\}^2 \\
    &\propto \sum_{\ast}
    \int \dif{\vec{u}} \left\{\sum_j\left(a_j^\ast
    - \sum_{k} b^\mathrm{tel}_{jk} Z_k(\vec{\theta}_\ast)
    - \sum_{ik} \mathbb{1}_i(\ast) c^i_{jk} Z_k(\vec{\theta}_\ast)
    - \sum_{ink} \mathbb{1}_n(R^{\phi_i} \vec{\theta}_\ast) \mathbb{1}_i(\ast) \sum_{j^\prime} d_{n j^\prime k} M^{\phi_i}_{j j^\prime} Z_k(R^{\phi_i} \vec{\theta}_\ast)
    \right) Z_j(\vec{u})\right\}^2 \\
\end{align}
\end{equation}

We use the notation $\mathbb{1}_i(\ast)$ to indicate if a given star was
observed on the $i$th exposure.

Expanding the $\left\{\cdot\right\}^2$ above, we can perform the integral over
$\dif{\vec{u}}$ by taking advantage of the orthogonality of Zernike polynomials:

\begin{equation}
    \int Z_j(\vec{u}) Z_{j^\prime}(\vec{u}) \dif \vec{u} = \pi \delta_{j j^\prime}
\end{equation}

Essentially, only the squares of the terms being indexed by $j$ survive, and all
the cross terms vanish.  This leaves us with

\begin{equation}
    \sum_j \sum_{\ast}
    \left\{a_j^\ast
    - \sum_{k} b^\mathrm{tel}_{jk} Z_k(\vec{\theta}_\ast)
    - \sum_{ik} \mathbb{1}_i(\ast) c^i_{jk} Z_k(\vec{\theta}_\ast)
    - \sum_{ink} \mathbb{1}_n(R^{\phi_i} \vec{\theta}_\ast) \mathbb{1}_i(\ast) \sum_{j^\prime} d_{n j^\prime k} M^{\phi_i}_{j j^\prime} Z_k(R^{\phi_i} \vec{\theta}_\ast)
    \right\}^2
    \label{eqn:loss}
\end{equation}

(with the square now occuring \textit{inside} the summation over $j$).

Although Eq. \ref{eqn:loss} may look complicated, since the terms corresponding
to the model are linear in each of the unknown variables of the model
($b^\mathrm{tel}_{jk}$, $c^i_{jk}$, and $d_{njk}$), we can solve it via standard
linear algebra routines.  Figuratively, we are looking for the least squares
solution to:

\begin{equation}
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \dots & \dots & \dots \\
    \dots & \mathrm{geometry} & \dots \\
    \dots & \dots & \dots
  \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathrm{b's} \\
    \dots \\
    \mathrm{c's} \\
    \dots \\
    \mathrm{d's} \\
    \dots
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \dots \\
    \mathrm{a's} \\
    \dots
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  \label{eqn:matrix}
\end{equation}

Also note that the $\{b^\mathrm{tel}_{jk}\}$, and $\{c^i_{jk}\}$ unknown
coefficients only occur in terms that include $a_j^\ast$, i.e., they never occur
in a term that includes $a_{j^\prime}^\ast$ with $j \ne j^\prime$.  Similarly,
the unknown $\{d_{n j^\prime k}\}$ coefficients only occur in terms with at most
one of two different values of $a_j^\ast$, which follows from our earlier
comment that $M^\phi_{j j^\prime}$ only ever has at most 2 non-zero entries per
row or column.  These facts enable us to find the minimum of Eq. \ref{eqn:loss}
in blocks of either 1 or 2 $j$ values at a time.

\subsection{Configuration}

In the above formalism, we never explicitly mentioned the upper indices of the
various summations.  In some cases, these may be fairly obvious, like the upper
index over $i$ is the number of exposure pairs being analyzed, and the upper
index over $n$ is the number of CCDs being analyzed.  In other cases, we
consciously omitted the indices because they are part of the model design --
they're flexible.  For example, the sum over $j$ and $k$ in $W_\mathrm{tel}$
(Eq. \ref{eqn:Wtel}) indicates how much complexity in the pupil (the $j$ index)
and across the field of view (the $k$ index) we want to allow in the
constant-continuous part of the model.  Our intuition for this term from
observing donut fits and from modeling the HSC optics is to allow a large amount
of freedom in the field-of-view dependence of $W_\mathrm{tel}$, and set
$k^\mathrm{max}_\mathrm{tel} = 55$, which is an arbitrary 10th order 2D
polynomial.  The visit term should probably have less freedom than this, as we
expect flexure and temperature fluctuations to induce mostly slowly varying
changes to the wavefront.  We choose $k^\mathrm{max}_{visit} = 10$, which is a
3rd degree polynomial.  For $W_CCD$, we only use $k^\mathrm{max}_{CCD} = 1$,
indicating that each CCD only has freedom to change the wavefront by a constant
amount over the CCD.  For each of these terms, we also choose $j^\mathrm{max} =
21$, simply because that's the largest value of $j$ for which we made donut fits
$a_j$.

With the above index upper limits, and using 10 visits and 104 CCDs, our
complete model has 4230 parameters to fit.  We have 20984 donut measurements to
constrain the model, or 377712 individual $a_j^\ast$ Zernike measurements.

Before we can build the "geometry" matrix of Eqn \ref{eqn:matrix} and fit the
model, we must address one final point, which is that even with many times more
data points than parameters, our model currently has too much freedom to have a
unique best fit solution -- it's degenerate.  For example, raising the value of
$b^\mathrm{tel}_{4,1}$ is degenerate with both lowering the values of each of
$c^i_{4,1}$, or lowering the values of each of $d_{n 4 1}$.  To fix this, we
add the constraint functions

\begin{equation}
  \sum_i c^i_{jk} = 0
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n} d_{n j^\prime k} = 0
\end{equation}

which select a unique solution from the otherwise infinite set of degenerate
solutions.  The above equations are simply additional rows in the "geometry"
matrix and corresponding 0's added to the "a's" matrix of Eqn. \ref{eqn:matrix}.

In figure \ref{fig:design4}, we show the design matrix for the $j=4$ block of
Eqn. \ref{eqn:loss}.  Each row corresponds to an individual donut measurement
$a^*_4$.  The columns of this design matrix show 3 broad distinct regions, which
correspond from left-to-right with $W_\mathrm{tel}$, $W_\mathrm{CCD}$, and
$W_\mathrm{visit}$.  Within the $W_\mathrm{CCD}$ region, we can see further
subdivisions that correspond to individual CCDs, and within the
$W_mathrm{visit}$ section, we can see individual visits.  In short, the
structure of the design matrix is that every donut constraints $W_\mathrm{tel}$,
constrains the $W_\mathrm{CCD}$ parameters corresponding to the 1 CCD that it
lands on in the 1 visit, and constrains $W_\mathrm{visit}$ parameters that
correspond to its particular visit.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:design56}, we show the design matrix for the combined $j=5$
and $j=6$ block of Eqn. \ref{eqn:loss}.  The same subblocks as in Figure
\ref{fig:design4} are apparent, but doubled.  The doubling is a consequence of
the mixing of $Z_5$ and $Z_6$ under a coordinate system rotation, as discussed
earlier.
